### hello, saludos, bon dia ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github. 

My name is dany. 

My moniker on the internet for more than a decade now has been k.o.d.3000. 

The acronym stands for knowledge on demand, as I have a love of learning.

The majority of my work is private due to client ndas, but i do try to throw some public ones now and again.
However, my public facing repos are kinda sad since they dont get the same attention as the private ones do.. if you'd like a walk through
of some of the work I do just contact me. I'd be happy to share.
